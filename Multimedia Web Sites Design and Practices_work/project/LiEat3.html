Then, after fighting with the lie-corrupting Sid, Sid will turn to normal, Sid tells out the truth. He joined 
the gang is because they stole too many things at that time, the boss of the gang said if he wants to save 
their little thief group, he needs to pay money.

Therefore, he lied to Cyril, Gene, and Enos, he told them to leave and gave the money to them. That 
money was Teo selling one of his kidneys to get it. Even he earned enough money for the transaction, the 
gang still not letting him go, so he changed a new identity, every time he moves to a new place.
